# MikroVoice
voice event notification system for Microtik routers

If you insert scripts into your router's repository one at a time, then you should select one fSMP function depending on your hardware.

To add the entire MikroVoice library, use MikroVoiceSys.rsc, which will be posted here later

You can download the sound jingles for the system from the link: https://cloud.mail.ru/public/741f/9R317bvM5
